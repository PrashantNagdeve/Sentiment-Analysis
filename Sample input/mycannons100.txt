I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.  
I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
The only thing I do not like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I do not have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
I'd say that this camera is perfect.
It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket.
This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is a gas station.
The flash is weak.
it is really disapointing
I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
it is so annoying
This is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to

it is not bad
Good quality and fun
All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
It's a little jewel.
Excellent software package.
Definitely a good investment.
