I am glad that I do not work for Norton
I had one problem after another
Live update would not function
i was so baffled
The tests were right.
By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
Their site does not  offers  live help at all.
A security software suite with lots of value
It's become tedious doing this.
I suspect that many people are having a bad experience, do not purchase this product.
I just about lost it this morning with this software.
I really liked the firewall.
The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
The Antivirus is good
I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
I've seen many good reviews for this product 
It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
phishing program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
I can't warn you enough to STAY FROM NORTON!!
I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
I can't recommend their programs enough.
About a month, it had an error that I could not fix 
And the program would not update.
I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
