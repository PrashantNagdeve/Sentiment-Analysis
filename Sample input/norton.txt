I am glad that I do not work for Norton
I had one problem after another
Live update would not function
i was so baffled
The tests were right.
By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
I didn't have any major problems installing this software.

I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
Their site does not  offers  live help at all.
A security software suite with lots of value
It's become tedious doing this.
I suspect that many people are having a bad experience, do not purchase this product.
I just about lost it this morning with this software.
I really liked the firewall.

The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
